- Set the opening scene
- Make decisions and interact with the story
- Branching story paths

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key (for ChatGPT integration)
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable: `export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here`
2. Run the main script: `python main.py`

## Extending
- Add more story templates or genres in `story_templates.py`.
- Customize prompts and branching logic in `main.py`.
